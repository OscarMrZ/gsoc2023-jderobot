# Python challenge

## Introduction 

This is a very simple implementation of a brownian motion "bump and go" robot. 

## How it works

I've written two basic classes, *Robot* and *BrownianRobotSimulation*. The goal of the first one is to update the position and direction of the robot when needed depending on the linear and angular speeds. The goal of the second one is to update a simple MatplotLib animation.
