# ROS2 challenge

## Simple pub-sub

I adapted the basic pub sub example in the ros2 wiki. 

## Visualising robot laser

I installed the tb3 robot and created a launcher to launch gazebo and the navigation. Once it starts, the laser (among other things), can be easily visualized. 

## Navigating with clicked waypoints

Using the rviz2 interface, waypoints are passed to nav2. 

## Simple patrolling application

I created an application which navigates through different waypoints iteratively using Behavior Trees. 

## Demo
